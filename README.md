# Remember

Remember is an notetaking application that allows you to take notes by including text, images, videos, links, lists, checkboxes and support for code snippets, file attachments can be expected in the near future.

Remember is built with React, Redux Toolkit and Firebase. Remember uses firestore to store the user notes and it uses Editor.js library for editing the notes.
